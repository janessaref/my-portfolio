# My Portfolio

In this project, I've created a functional and responsive portfolio utilizing the Bootstrap CSS Framework as well as utilizing the Bootstrap grid system so that the website and its layout works on different devices and browsers. This project is all about consistency and functionality. The requirements of this project include the following:

* Consistent navbar on each of the required working links:
    * About
    * Portfolio
    * Contact
* Main content 
    * Biography
    * Portfolio containing projects
    * Contact information form
* HTML semantic elements
* A sticky footer
