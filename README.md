# My Portfolio

In this project, I've created a functional and responsive portfolio utilizing the Bootstrap CSS Framework as well as utilizing the Bootstrap grid system so that the website and its layout works on different devices and browsers. This project is all about consistency and functionality. The requirements of this project include the following:

* Consistent navbar on each of the required working links:
    * About
    * Portfolio
    * Contact

* Main content 
    * Biography
    * Portfolio containing projects (to be updated)
    * Contact information form

* Usage of HTML semantic elements
* A sticky footer
* A responsive layout and images
* Screenshots of website in different screen sizes (see photos below)

## Features

This project includes a number of features including:

* A navbar with functional links

    In this navbar, you need to be aware of the detail of keeping your links active if you're on that current page. Adding color to my name as a sort of emphasis of my portfolio.

* Main content

    * About Me

        In the about page, adding a card title as your base while utilizing the bootstrap grid system and attaching an image, a short paragraph about myself and links to my social media accounts and in this case, I utilized the logos.

    * Portfolio
    
        In this portfolio page, although still no projects added in. I've added a placeholder image and placeholder links that may lead to the specific project's deployed link or to the github repository containing pertaining to that project.

    * Contact

        In this page, this was built again in a card title and added a form to be filled out by anyone who would like to reach out.

    * A sticky footer

        This feature was a tricky one. I did attempt a sticky footer and it worked except at a certain screen size moved a little bit away from the bottom of the page so I have attempted instead to use the fixed feature.
